This is a course registration that is designed to handle students with double majors, courses with prerequisites, and electives filling required categories for a student. Students, which are different classes based on their major or double major, can add and drop courses and see what requirements they still need to fufill. Additionally, courses have start and end times and enrollment will check for potential course overlaps.
